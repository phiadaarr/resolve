* How to convert a measurement set to a npz file with Docker

Assume that the measurement set folder is located at
`/data/<ms-folder>`. Then the following commands create the npz-files
`/data/<outputname>field<i>.npz` from it.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
docker build -f misc/Dockerfile -t <tag> .
docker run -v /data:/mnt <tag> mnt/<ms-folder> mnt/<outputname>
#+END_SRC

Note that the first command needs to be run from the project root of
resolve. It installs the current checked out version of resolve into
the Docker container.
